testRun2.m - apply decoding and plot
- plotting requires some manuvering and uncommenting 

extractChronuxFeatures3_1.m - ** most recent **
- Extract power for whole signal + other changes

- must run preprocessing step first to generate features file, then conflict modulation step

old:

extractChronuxFeatures.m - original with band power not z score

extractChronuxFeatures2.m - with z score

extractChronuxFeatures3.m - changing the way the band power is cut
- Add preprocessing support for their data
